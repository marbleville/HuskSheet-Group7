# HuskSheet-Group7 (Group 1)

## Project Description

The course project is a distributed collaborative spreadsheet application called Husksheets. It consists of (1) a server with a persistent store, (2) a client able to create and open spreadsheets, and (3) a user interface that displays sheets and allows editing them.

## Overview

Our project is split into two distinct parts, the server and the client.
